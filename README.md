This repository tracks my weekly coding practice and learning as I work through Codecademy’s data-related courses (Spring 2025 and beyond).

## 📌 Purpose
- Strengthen fluency in Python, SQL, and data tools
- Reinforce concepts through hands-on practice
- Develop habits around thoughtful, consistent coding
- Build toward polished projects and storytelling


## 📚 Current Courses
- **Analyze Financial Data with Python** (March–April 2025)

🗒️ The notes/ folder is currently excluded from version control via .gitignore to allow for private, in-progress learning notebooks. Public-facing summaries or cleaned versions may be added here in the future.


### Folder Descriptions

- `analyze-financial-data/` → Practice notebooks from the Codecademy course
- `notes/` → Personal notes, comparisons, and learning references
- `assets/` → Images and plots for future visualizations

## ⚙️ Setup
To run these notebooks locally:
### 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jennifer-marie-nyc/data-practice-journal.git
cd data-practice-journal

### 2. Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Launch Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab

This repo uses a simplified requirements.txt to keep things lightweight (jupyterlab, numpy, and later, additional packages as needed).

---

## 🚧 In Progress

- Weekly commits as I work through lessons and projects
- Occasional notes comparing Python vs JavaScript for cross-language fluency
- Later: polished notebooks for portfolio inclusion

---

## 🌀 Future Focus Areas

- Data storytelling with Python and Jupyter
- Behavioral insights, market research, and consumer trends
- Projects that integrate analytics with writing and research

---

_This repo is meant to evolve—like me._ ☁️
