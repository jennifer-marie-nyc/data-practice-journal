# Data Practice Journal 🧠📊

This repository tracks my weekly coding practice and learning as I work through Codecademy’s data-related courses (Spring 2025 and beyond).

## 📌 Purpose
- Strengthen fluency in Python, SQL, and data tools
- Reinforce concepts through hands-on practice
- Develop habits around thoughtful, consistent coding
- Build toward polished projects and storytelling


## 📚 Current Courses
- **Analyze Financial Data with Python** (March–April 2025)

🗒️ The notes/ folder is currently excluded from version control via .gitignore to allow for private, in-progress learning notebooks. Public-facing summaries or cleaned versions may be added here in the future.

### Folder Descriptions

- `analyze-financial-data/` → Practice notebooks from the Codecademy course
- `notes/` → Personal notes, comparisons, and learning references
- `assets/` → Images and plots for future visualizations
