    "\n",
    "Although Iâ€™ve worked with statistical concepts in R (including multivariate modeling during my MA in psychology), Iâ€™m still building fluency in Python. NumPy offers a fast, flexible way to perform calculations and manipulate numerical dataâ€”especially useful when I start working with behavioral datasets or preparing data for storytelling.\n",
