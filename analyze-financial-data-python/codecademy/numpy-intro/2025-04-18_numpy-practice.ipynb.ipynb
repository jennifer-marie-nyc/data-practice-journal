    "\n",
    "This notebook includes selected notes and practice examples from Codecademyâ€™s *Introduction to NumPy* module. Rather than documenting every step, Iâ€™ve focused on the concepts that felt most relevant to reinforce, revisit, or apply in future analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although Iâ€™ve worked with statistical concepts in R (including multivariate modeling during my MA in psychology), Iâ€™m still building fluency in Python. NumPy offers a fast, flexible way to perform calculations and manipulate numerical dataâ€”especially useful when I start working with behavioral datasets or preparing data for storytelling.\n",

    "This is part of my ongoing effort to connect past training with new tools, and to make my learning process visible as I build toward more complex, project-based work.\n"
